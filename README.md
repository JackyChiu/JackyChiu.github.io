By creating my own website I hope to display my knowledge of simple web development and have some experience with HTML and CSS. I learned majority of what I know about web development on Codeacademy, and everything else I learned by viewing the source code of well designed websites, and though Google.

The website is designed to be view on a computer, but can be viewed on mobile.

I used Bootstrap's css framework for my website as well and FontAwesome's icons for my footers.

I created most of my website throughout a long weekend and will continue to update it as I learn more about web development. I hope to add some animations to my website soon.
